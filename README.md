# Borehole IE

## Summary
Borehole and associated data are crucial for many domains. They are used in any domain that need to probe the underground; geology (hydrogeology, oil and gas, mining), civil engineering (utilities, constructions, transportation) and environment (ice coring, limnology, etc.).

Even though several standards already exist to describe a borehole, its associated data and their position along a borehole (including OGC standards), they all restrict themselves to a specific viewpoint. 

Involving key implementers and editors of the existing standards, this Interoperability Experiment (IE) aims at clarifying the commonalities and differences of the diverse approaches by providing a semantic umbrella linked to the pre-existing work by distilling the core elements shared by all disciplines. This will provide the basis for establishing a better integration of existing standards and possibly a future common approach for describing boreholes.

The IE will produce the semantic umbrella and an OGC engineering report summarizing the achievements and listing the potential adjustments to be made on the pre-existing standards so that the system as a whole is at the end coherent.
